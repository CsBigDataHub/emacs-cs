YAEC - Yet Another Emacs Cheat Sheet
====================================

Rationale
---------

I'm studying the IBM Emacs tutorial (you can read the first module at
the [IBM Developer Works][1]) and I feel the need of taking note of
what I'm reading. So I started to write this cheat sheet.

[1]: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/tutorials/au-emacs1/index.html

I'm studyng XML and XSLT too, so I preferred to use XML to track down
my Emacs commands.


How to use this cheat sheet.
----------------------------

The body of the cheat sheet is an XML structure contained into the
file `emcsh.xml`; since it's provided a stylesheet for the XML
(`tohtml.xsl`), you can read the cheat sheet directly with the web
browser. I use firefox; I don't know if other browsers are good
enough.

The stylesheet contains directives for printing, so you can print the
cheatsheet with the "print" feature of your web browser (again, it is
tested on firefox, I don't know anything about other browsers).
